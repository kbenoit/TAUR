# Text Analysis Using R: A Practical Introduction

*Kenneth Benoit*

This is the site to host my book in progress of the above title.  It's rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [hugo-material-docs theme](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-material-docs) created by @digitalcraftsman.

While the book is not exclusive to the R [**quanteda**](https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) package for text analysis, it does focus heavily on that package.
